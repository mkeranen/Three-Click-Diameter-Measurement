# Three-Click-Diameter-Measurement

This script calculates the diameter of a sample feature using a known dimension of a reference feature. 
The script opens an image and prompts the user to select 3 points along the diameter of the sample feature 
to be measured, and then again to select 3 points along the diameter of the reference object.

The selected three points are used to calculate a center and radius for a circle whose circumference contains the three selected points.
